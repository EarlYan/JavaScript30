# JavaScript30
Build 30 things in 30 days with 30 tutorials. There is NO FRAMEWORKS, NO COMPILERS, NO LIBRARIES, NO BOILERPLATE.


##WHAT IS IT?
  As we all know, there are too many libs, frameworks or any others. Yes, it can make us to work better. However, do we think about  why couldn't make some great things? I think we used many tools and not tried to understand why. We just read documents and use it. We know a little of them. Most of them is base code by ECMAScript5. So I want to do this.

##HOW TO DO?
I will push code from Feb 6, 2017 for 30 days and build 30 things. To make sure we understand JavaScript. This is very useful.
