# JavaScript30
Build 30 things in 30 days with 30 tutorials. There is NO FRAMEWORKS, NO COMPILERS, NO LIBRARIES, NO BOILERPLATE.


##WHAT IS IT?
  As we all know, there are too many libs, frameworks or any other. Yes, it can make us to work better. However, do we think about why we couldn't make some great things? I think we use many tools and not try to understand why. We just read documents and use it. We know a little of them. Most of them is code by base JavaScript.So i want to do this.

##HOW TO DO?
I will push some code from Feb 6, 2017 for 30 days and build 30 things. To make sure we understand JavaScript. This is very useful.
